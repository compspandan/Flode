# Flode

### Motivation
Imagine students living in rural areas with poor internet connectivity, or students who do not have access to laptops but still want to learn programming. 
There are no easy and accessible ways for individuals with a lack of laptop or personal computing devices to learn this essential skill.
Unfortunately, introductory coding tutorials directly start teaching basic programming statements with not much effort given to logical thinking. 
In reality, the fundamental way to crack any programming question is to develop adequate problem-solving skills rather than to learn syntax. 

### What is Flode?
Flode is a mobile application that teaches programming through flowcharts. 
It incorporates beautiful animations and drag-and-drop physics by allowing the user to structure logical statements by solving programming and logical challenges. 
The application is completely offline which makes it easier for rural students to access all the features without an active internet connection. 

### The goal is to make programming more interactive, enjoyable and accessible.
